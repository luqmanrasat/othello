HOW TO PLAY

 - Game is for two players, 'X' and 'O'.

 - Pieces may flank the opponent's pieces in more than 1 direction at the same
   time. All flanked pieces are turned over in the same turn, becoming the
   opponent's property.

 - If on your turn you have no legal moves, your turn is forfeited and your
   opponent moves again. However, if a move is available to you, you may not
   forfeit your turn.

 - When it is no longer possible for either player to move, the game is over.
   Pieces are counted and the player with the majority of his or her pieces on
   the board is the winner.

 - Each players have 3 super powers that can only be used once. If not used
   and there is no more possible move left, game will proceed to end.
